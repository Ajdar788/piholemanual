This repository contains the files, referred to in my pi-hole installation [manual](https://nbviewer.org/github/jpgpi250/piholemanual/blob/master/doc/Block%20Ads%20Network-wide%20with%20A%20Raspberry%20Pi-hole.pdf).

The googleads script is explained [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/jpgpi250/piholemanual/blob/master/doc/Whitelist%20Google%20Ads%20with%20Pi-hole%20v5.pdf).

The usage of the DOH related files is explained in [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/jpgpi250/piholemanual/blob/master/doc/Block%20DOH%20with%20pfsense.pdf) document.

If you want to clone your SD card successfully, using [Win32DiskImager](https://win32diskimager.org/), you need to read [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/jpgpi250/piholemanual/blob/master/doc/Manually%20resize%20partition%20for%20Backup.pdf) document.

Some scripts may contain IP addresses, which need to be edited, to allow correct processing.

Thanks to jupyter [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) for rendering the pdf files.
